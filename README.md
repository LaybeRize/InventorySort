# InventorySort
A small python program that was written to showcase an intuitive algorithm to solve the drag and drop sorting problem

The algorithm is encapsulated in its own class, using the abstracted Array as an input, to ease use of necessary operations.

The DragAndDrop class and tkinter.Labels are purely for showing a visualized example.
